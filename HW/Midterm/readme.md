###  Code
   * A counter is controled by the two big buttons, one adds to the counter, one subtracts.
   * based on value of the counter is how many LEDs are turned on at a time
   * When all LEDs are on or off a buzzer goes off signaling a winner

##### Reflection
* I wanted to be able to reset the game, reset button needs work
* I want the LEDs to be more visible
* Add a way for others to see game progress
