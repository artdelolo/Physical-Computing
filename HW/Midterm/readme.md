### [CONTROL THE LIGHT](https://vimeo.com/lorenalopez/review/334810182/f79a6238a9)

### You are the goddess Persephone and must get back to the Underworld without hitting one of your mother, Demeter's wheat bundles!

 Using the up arrow to jump over the wheat, you must journey to the entrance of the Underworld as the seasons change around you.

Greek mythology has always been a strong interest of mine, and something I haven't seen many interactive games geared towards children with. I wanted to try and create a simple game that introduced some key elements of the myth of Hades and Persephone but animated in a childlike manner. While I was unable to complete the project with my full idea of a second player who controls the seasons, it is something I would like to add later on.
