# SENSOR WALK

I visited the Perez Art Museum Miami for my sensor walk, here are a few sensors I came in contact with along the way.

* Proximity sensor at the parking gate
* Humidity sensors in the galleries tracking the rooms
* Not a sensor but a timed switch in the American Exho Chamber exhibit

# PARTS RESEARCH

Part of this sensor walk got me thinking about light sensors and if they are used to track the amount of UV light in a a room, and whether or not this is used to protect pieces of art from light damage.

This led to the development of my photo light proposal for the midterm.
